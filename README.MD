The JSON file is in the format of..
```
{
  "Author": {
    "game_version": {
      "mod.qmod": "https://website.where.qmod.is.hosted.com/mod.qmod"
    }
  }
}
```

You can use any number of subtrees you would like. The above example will redirect
`https://mods.bsquest.xyz/Author/game_version/mod.qmod` to `https://website.where.qmod.is.hosted.com/mod.qmod`
